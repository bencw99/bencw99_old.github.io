		<form action="">
			Enter password: <input type="password" id="password" />
			<input type="submit" value="Access" onclick="alert('Access Denied');" />
		</form>
		<p>Even without the password, you can download two games I made below called MoonLander and Adventure Game.</p>
		<p>To play them, click on the links below, extract their files from the zip files downloaded, and click on the file called Game.jar</p>
		<p>Make sure to keep the file named Game.jar in the same folder as the images and files, or else the games won't work.</p>
		<p>I am still working on the Adventure Game. For now, a user can choose an avatar, walk around with the arrow keys, pick up items with d, and use items with the space bar.</p>
		<p>The moonlander game is completed and was the first game I made in java. The user can control a rocket using the arrow keys and change various attributes of the rocket and controls in the settings page</p>
