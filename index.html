		<p>Welcome to my website!</p>
		<p>I am currently learning java, and below you can download two games I made below called MoonLander and Adventure Game.</p>
		<p>To play them, click on the links below, extract their files from the zip files downloaded, and click on the file called Game.jar. Make sure to keep the file named Game.jar in the same folder as the images and files, or else the games won't work.</p>
		<p>I am still working on the Adventure Game. For now, a user can choose an avatar, walk around with the arrow keys, pick up items with d, and use items with the space bar.</p>
		<p>The moonlander game is completed and was the first game I made in java. The user can control a rocket using the arrow keys and change various attributes of the rocket and controls in the settings page</p>
